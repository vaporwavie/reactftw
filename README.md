## React FTW
This is a personal project intended on learning how to use React framework. You can clone and use it if you
want, but I warn you since now that the whole thing is pretty much looking like Windows 98. :joy:

## How do I use/install it?
Believe me, it's very simple! Follow these steps:

* Clone this repo
* I strongly recommend you to use <code>yarn</code> in order to install de packages instead of <code>npm install</code>. Buuut, you choose.
* <code>npm install -g webpack-dev-server && npm install</code> or <code>yarn && yarn add webpack-web-server global</code>
* Execute it by typing <code>webpack-dev-server</code> at your terminal. Localhost will probably be at port 8080.

by lambos and palm trees. This is not a joke.
